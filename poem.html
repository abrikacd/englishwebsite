    <h2>Carol Ann Duffy’s poems mainly touch on the theme of alienation, oppression, and social inequality. These poems were chosen because they are all linked to the same global issue of Politics, Power, and Justice. Each of these poems give an unconventional voice to female characters from popular fairy tales and folklore which links to Carol Ann Duffy’s overall theme of gender inequality. Overall, these poems are made under the assumption that power is given to those we hear out. By allowing readers to see the story from the woman’s perspective, Carol Ann Duffy changes the usual significant viewpoint.</h2>
