        <h2>In Medusa by Carol Ann Duffy, the speaker, identified as the mythological Medusa, expresses deep jealousy, insecurity, and the destructive power of self-loathing. Through the unique lens of Medusa, the poem explores themes of isolation, obsessive jealousy, and the corrosive effects of unchecked emotions. The poem delves into the theme of jealousy and its capacity to destroy both the individual and relationships. The way Medusa describes herself shows how internalized rage and insecurity can lead to self-destruction. Her isolation is another key theme, as her jealousy isolates her from others, transforming her into a literal and metaphorical monster. Carol Ann Duffy uses a multitude of techniques such as alliteration in line 6 representing the transmutation of Medusaâ€™s thoughts, and rhyme to give stanza 3 unity. In conclusion, Medusa in this poem is clinging desperately to the memory of the lovely woman she was. Whatever the interpretation, most readers will feel sympathy, though not without fear.</h2>
