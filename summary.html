    <h2>Carol Ann Duffy, being the first openly gay and female Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, challenges conventional power structures through a creative and touching voice. Duffy is also innovative as a poet, writing in a conversational way that appears deceptively simple. Because of this, more people who otherwise find poetry “boring” or “too complicated” are likely to read her poems and find themselves questioning these same problems. </h2>
    <h2>Carol Ann Duffy’s works have a significant impact on society mainly by addressing topics that would otherwise be seen as “taboo”. Carol Ann Duffy does not shy away from possibly offensive language and directly addresses issues through creative prompts (such as Mrs. Midas and Money Talks). Her poems give an entirely new perspective on stories we’ve heard before and people who society has refused to give a voice to time and time again.
    </h2>
    <h2>Overall, Carol Ann Duffy has made a lasting impact on society through her nuanced yet digestible literature, making it perfect for people who don’t usually read poetry to understand and empathize with her works.</h2>
