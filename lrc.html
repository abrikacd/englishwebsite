        <h2>In this retelling of Little Red Riding Hood, Duffy’s character seeks and enjoys the sexual relationship with “the wolf”. However, by the end of the poem, she detaches herself from him in pursuit of independence and power. The poem reimagines the classic fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood, using vivid imagery, symbolism, and modern language to explore themes of innocence, sexual awakening, and the abuse of power. Duffy uses direct and evocative imagery, such as "Red wine staining his bearded jaw" and "What big eyes he had!" to highlight the predatory nature of the male figure. The wolf symbolizes both sexual danger and exploitation. There’s a sharp contrast between the innocence of Little Red Cap and the dangerous, manipulative wolf, symbolizing the tension between childhood and adult experience. The use of enjambment and colloquial language adds a contemporary feel, making the poem accessible while maintaining a sense of tension. The tone also shifts from innocence to self-empowerment, as Little Red Cap ultimately takes control, with her axe suggesting a reclaiming of power. Overall, Duffy employs the traditional narrative structure but reconfigures it to offer a feminist critique.</h2>
