        <h2>In Carol Ann Duffy’s poem "Mrs. Sisyphus," the speaker expresses frustration and resentment towards her husband, Sisyphus, who is eternally condemned to push a massive stone uphill, only for it to roll back down.<br>This repetitive struggle becomes a source of irritation and alienation for her. The speaker reflects on her own feelings of isolation and futility, comparing her situation to that of other historical or mythological figures who endured similar burdens. Despite Sisyphus's optimistic outlook, she feels trapped and voices her contempt for the absurdity of his task.
            Duffy employs a colloquial tone, using informal language and humor to convey the speaker’s exasperation.<br>The poem features vivid imagery, especially in describing the stone and the hill, which symbolize overwhelming burdens and relentless struggles. The rhyme scheme adds a rhythmic quality, enhancing the poem’s emotional impact.
            Themes of alienation, gender roles, and the absurdity of existence are central. The speaker’s struggle reflects broader societal issues, particularly the often unseen emotional labor of women and the lack of recognition for their sacrifices. Duffy critiques the glorification of relentless work, suggesting that personal fulfillment is overshadowed by societal expectations and the monotony of daily life. This resonates with contemporary discussions about work-life balance and the roles individuals play in both private and public spheres.
